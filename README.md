Smart Meter Data Generator (Cluster version)
======================
This is the cluster-based smart meter data generator that can generate large-scale smart meter time series in parallel. For the standalone version that runs on a single server, please refer to [Data Generator (Standalone Version)](https://github.com/xiufengliu/DataGenerator-Standalone-Version). 

This data generator is implemented in Spark. It generates data with a real-world residential electricity consumption as the seed.
